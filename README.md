# Information Security with HelmetJS

This is the app I made to follow along with [learning to use Helmet](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-with-helmetjs/) with FCC.

UPDATE: done and dusted after merging all helmet middleware into a parent helmet() call, except for noCache(), which is still listed separately
